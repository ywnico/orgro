# Orgro + id links
This is an Android-only fork of Orgro to enable cross-file `id:` links, for use with, e.g., [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam). The user may select a notes directory, and all contained files are scanned for `id:` links. Backlinks are not yet implemented.

- Unfortunately it requires enabling the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
- I made this for my personal use and I have limited experience with Flutter and Android development, so it's very hacky (especially since the directory scanning is done in a way incompatible with `FilePickerWritable`). I haven't done any testing except on my personal device.
- For the above reasons, I think it is not currently upstreamable.

# What is Org Mode?

Imagine a plain-text markup language like Markdown, but married to an
application that is a literate programming environment and life organizer. In
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

# Why?

I started taking notes in Org Mode at work, then found myself wanting to view
them on my tablet in meetings. By default on iOS you can't open an `.org` file
at all, as the OS doesn't even know that it's plain text.

Other mobile Org Mode apps are focused on very different things like to-dos or
task management; Orgro is instead first and foremost a *viewer*, letting you see
and search the contents of your org files.

I also wanted to try writing a parser with
[PetitParser](https://github.com/petitparser/dart-petitparser); the result
powers this application and is available as a separate library,
[org_parser](https://github.com/amake/org_parser).

# Features

- Syntax highlighting for most Org Mode syntax structures
- Expand and collapse sections, blocks, and drawers
- Reflow text for easy viewing on narrow screens
- Pretty table rendering
- Functional external links and section links
- Visibility cycling
- Search
- Narrowing
- "Reader mode" where extraneous markup is hidden
- Inline and block LaTeX rendering

See the [manual](./assets/manual/orgro-manual.org) for details.

# Limitations

Orgro is a viewer. It does not support editing at all.

Many Org Mode syntax structures are highlighted but not meaningfully
interpreted.
